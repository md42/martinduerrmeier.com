## Relevant legal bases {#m2427}

**Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:** In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.

*   **Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)** - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
*   **Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)** - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
*   **Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)** - the processing is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not prevail.

**National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

**Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA:** These privacy policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.

## Security Precautions {#m27}

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.

Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being securely and encryptedly transmitted.

## Transmission of Personal Data {#m25}

In the course of processing personal data, it may happen that this data is transmitted to or disclosed to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals. Recipients of this data may include service providers tasked with IT duties or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and particularly conclude relevant contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

## International data transfers {#m24}

Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if the processing is done within the context of using third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other individuals, entities, or companies, this is only done in accordance with legal requirements. If the data protection level in the third country has been recognized by an adequacy decision (Article 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only occur if the data protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through standard contractual clauses (Article 46 (2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally required transfers (Article 49 (1) GDPR). Furthermore, we provide you with the basis of third-country transfers from individual third-country providers, with adequacy decisions primarily serving as the foundation. "Information regarding third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be obtained from the information provided by the EU Commission: [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection\_en.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en) Within the context of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the data protection level for certain companies from the USA as secure within the adequacy decision of 10th July 2023. The list of certified companies as well as additional information about the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/.](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/) We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our data protection notices.

## General Information on Data Retention and Deletion {#m12}

We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.

In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.

Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data specifically applicable to certain processing processes.

In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the longest period always prevails.

If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.

Data that is no longer stored for its originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons are processed exclusively for the reasons justifying their retention.

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Data Retention and Deletion:** The following general deadlines apply for the retention and archiving according to German law:
    *   10 Years - Fiscal Code/Commercial Code - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the necessary work instructions and other organisational documents, booking receipts and invoices (Section 147 Paragraph 3 in conjunction with Paragraph 1 No. 1, 4 and 4a of the German General Tax Code (AO), Section 14b Paragraph 1 of the German VAT Act (UStG), Section 257 Paragraph 1 Numbers 1 and 4, Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB)).

    *   3 Years - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar contractual claims and rights, as well as to process related inquiries, based on previous business experiences and common industry practices, will be stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years. This period begins at the end of the year in which the relevant contractual transaction took place or the contractual relationship ended in the case of ongoing contracts (Sections 195, 199 of the German Civil Code).

## Profiles in Social Networks (Social Media) {#m136}

We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.

We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may entail risks for users, e.g. by making it more difficult to enforce users' rights.

In addition, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created on the basis of user behaviour and the associated interests of users. The user profiles can then be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks which are presumed to correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behaviour and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective networks or will become members later on).

For a detailed description of the respective processing operations and the opt-out options, please refer to the respective data protection declarations and information provided by the providers of the respective networks.

Also in the case of requests for information and the exercise of rights of data subjects, we point out that these can be most effectively pursued with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information. If you still need help, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Within our online services, we integrate functional and content elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "Content").

The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents or functions. We strive to use only those contents, whose respective offerers use the IP address only for the distribution of the contents. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit times and other information about the use of our website, as well as may be linked to such information from other sources.

*   **Processed data types:** Usage data (e.g. page views and duration of visit, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, types of devices and operating systems used, interactions with content and features); Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, timestamps, identification numbers, involved parties); Contact data (e.g. postal and email addresses or phone numbers). Content data (e.g. textual or pictorial messages and contributions, as well as information pertaining to them, such as details of authorship or the time of creation.).
*   **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
*   **Purposes of processing:** Provision of our online services and usability; Profiles with user-related information (Creating user profiles). Marketing.
*   **Retention and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information provided in the section "General Information on Data Retention and Deletion". Storage of cookies for up to 2 years (Unless otherwise stated, cookies and similar storage methods may be stored on users' devices for a period of two years.).
*   **Legal Basis:** Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

**Further information on processing methods, procedures and services used:**

*   **Integration of third-party software, scripts or frameworks:** We incorporate into our online services software which we retrieve from servers of other providers (e.g. function libraries which we use for the purpose of displaying or user-friendliness of our online services). The respective providers collect the user's IP address and can process it for the purposes of transferring the software to the user's browser as well as for security purposes and for the evaluation and optimisation of their services; **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
*   **Google Fonts (from Google Server):** Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to timeliness and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible restrictions under licensing law. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data may be processed on a server of the provider of the fonts in the USA - When visiting our online services, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API. The Google Fonts Web API provides users with Google Fonts' cascading style sheets (CSS) and then with the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by each user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e., the web page where the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are not logged or stored on Google servers and they are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must match the font that is generated for the particular browser type. The user agent is logged primarily for debugging purposes and is used to generate aggregate usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are published on Google Fonts' Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report on top integrations based on the number of font requests. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or serve targeted ads; **Service provider**: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; **Legal Basis:** Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR); **Website:** [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/); **Privacy Policy:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy); **Basis for third-country transfers:** Data Privacy Framework (DPF). **Further Information:** [https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=en).

## Changes and Updates {#m15}

We kindly ask you to inform yourself regularly about the contents of our data protection declaration. We will adjust the privacy policy as changes in our data processing practices make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require your cooperation (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.

If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organizations in this privacy policy, we ask you to note that addresses may change over time and to verify the information before contacting us.

## Terminology and Definitions {#m42}

In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy. Where the terminology is legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid understanding.

*   **Contact data:** Contact details are essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. They include, among others, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as means of communication like social media handles and instant messaging identifiers.
*   **Content data:** Content data comprise information generated in the process of creating, editing, and publishing content of all types. This category of data may include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various platforms and media. Content data are not limited to the content itself but also include metadata providing information about the content, such as tags, descriptions, authorship details, and publication dates.
*   **Controller:** "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
*   **Inventory data:** Inventory data encompass essential information required for the identification and management of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar assignments. These data may include, among others, personal and demographic details such as names, contact information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data form the foundation for any formal interaction between individuals and services, facilities, or systems, by enabling unique assignment and communication.
*   **Log data:** Protocol data, or log data, refer to information regarding events or activities that have been logged within a system or network. These data typically include details such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other specifics about the usage or operation of a system. Protocol data is often used for analyzing system issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports.
*   **Meta, communication and process data:** Meta-, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Meta-data, also known as data about data, include information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. They can include details about file size, creation date, the author of a document, and modification histories. Communication data capture the exchange of information between users across various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages in social networks, and chat histories, including the involved parties, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describe the processes and operations within systems or organisations, including workflow documentations, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying procedures.
*   **Personal Data:** "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
*   **Processing:** The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure.
*   **Profiles with user-related information:** The processing of "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short, includes any kind of automated processing of personal data that consists of using these personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics, behaviour and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behaviour on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.
*   **Usage data:** Usage data refer to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of information that demonstrates how users utilise applications, which features they prefer, how long they spend on specific pages, and through what paths they navigate an application. Usage data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour, optimising user experiences, personalising content, and improving products or services. Furthermore, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings

## Maßgebliche Rechtsgrundlagen {#m2427}

**Maßgebliche Rechtsgrundlagen nach der DSGVO:** Im Folgenden erhalten Sie eine Übersicht der Rechtsgrundlagen der DSGVO, auf deren Basis wir personenbezogene Daten verarbeiten. Bitte nehmen Sie zur Kenntnis, dass neben den Regelungen der DSGVO nationale Datenschutzvorgaben in Ihrem bzw. unserem Wohn- oder Sitzland gelten können. Sollten ferner im Einzelfall speziellere Rechtsgrundlagen maßgeblich sein, teilen wir Ihnen diese in der Datenschutzerklärung mit.

*   **Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO)** - Die betroffene Person hat ihre Einwilligung in die Verarbeitung der sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten für einen spezifischen Zweck oder mehrere bestimmte Zwecke gegeben.
*   **Berechtigte Interessen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO)** - die Verarbeitung ist zur Wahrung der berechtigten Interessen des Verantwortlichen oder eines Dritten notwendig, vorausgesetzt, dass die Interessen, Grundrechte und Grundfreiheiten der betroffenen Person, die den Schutz personenbezogener Daten verlangen, nicht überwiegen.

**Nationale Datenschutzregelungen in Deutschland:** Zusätzlich zu den Datenschutzregelungen der DSGVO gelten nationale Regelungen zum Datenschutz in Deutschland. Hierzu gehört insbesondere das Gesetz zum Schutz vor Missbrauch personenbezogener Daten bei der Datenverarbeitung (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). Das BDSG enthält insbesondere Spezialregelungen zum Recht auf Auskunft, zum Recht auf Löschung, zum Widerspruchsrecht, zur Verarbeitung besonderer Kategorien personenbezogener Daten, zur Verarbeitung für andere Zwecke und zur Übermittlung sowie automatisierten Entscheidungsfindung im Einzelfall einschließlich Profiling. Ferner können Landesdatenschutzgesetze der einzelnen Bundesländer zur Anwendung gelangen.

**Hinweis auf Geltung DSGVO und Schweizer DSG:** Diese Datenschutzhinweise dienen sowohl der Informationserteilung nach dem Schweizer DSG als auch nach der Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO). Aus diesem Grund bitten wir Sie zu beachten, dass aufgrund der breiteren räumlichen Anwendung und Verständlichkeit die Begriffe der DSGVO verwendet werden. Insbesondere statt der im Schweizer DSG verwendeten Begriffe „Bearbeitung" von „Personendaten", "überwiegendes Interesse" und "besonders schützenswerte Personendaten" werden die in der DSGVO verwendeten Begriffe „Verarbeitung" von „personenbezogenen Daten" sowie "berechtigtes Interesse" und "besondere Kategorien von Daten" verwendet. Die gesetzliche Bedeutung der Begriffe wird jedoch im Rahmen der Geltung des Schweizer DSG weiterhin nach dem Schweizer DSG bestimmt.

## Sicherheitsmaßnahmen {#m27}

Wir treffen nach Maßgabe der gesetzlichen Vorgaben unter Berücksichtigung des Stands der Technik, der Implementierungskosten und der Art, des Umfangs, der Umstände und der Zwecke der Verarbeitung sowie der unterschiedlichen Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten und des Ausmaßes der Bedrohung der Rechte und Freiheiten natürlicher Personen geeignete technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen, um ein dem Risiko angemessenes Schutzniveau zu gewährleisten.

Zu den Maßnahmen gehören insbesondere die Sicherung der Vertraulichkeit, Integrität und Verfügbarkeit von Daten durch Kontrolle des physischen und elektronischen Zugangs zu den Daten als auch des sie betreffenden Zugriffs, der Eingabe, der Weitergabe, der Sicherung der Verfügbarkeit und ihrer Trennung. Des Weiteren haben wir Verfahren eingerichtet, die eine Wahrnehmung von Betroffenenrechten, die Löschung von Daten und Reaktionen auf die Gefährdung der Daten gewährleisten. Ferner berücksichtigen wir den Schutz personenbezogener Daten bereits bei der Entwicklung bzw. Auswahl von Hardware, Software sowie Verfahren entsprechend dem Prinzip des Datenschutzes, durch Technikgestaltung und durch datenschutzfreundliche Voreinstellungen.

Sicherung von Online-Verbindungen durch TLS-/SSL-Verschlüsselungstechnologie (HTTPS): Um die Daten der Nutzer, die über unsere Online-Dienste übertragen werden, vor unerlaubten Zugriffen zu schützen, setzen wir auf die TLS-/SSL-Verschlüsselungstechnologie. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) und Transport Layer Security (TLS) sind die Eckpfeiler der sicheren Datenübertragung im Internet. Diese Technologien verschlüsseln die Informationen, die zwischen der Website oder App und dem Browser des Nutzers (oder zwischen zwei Servern) übertragen werden, wodurch die Daten vor unbefugtem Zugriff geschützt sind. TLS, als die weiterentwickelte und sicherere Version von SSL, gewährleistet, dass alle Datenübertragungen den höchsten Sicherheitsstandards entsprechen. Wenn eine Website durch ein SSL-/TLS-Zertifikat gesichert ist, wird dies durch die Anzeige von HTTPS in der URL signalisiert. Dies dient als ein Indikator für die Nutzer, dass ihre Daten sicher und verschlüsselt übertragen werden.

## Übermittlung von personenbezogenen Daten {#m25}

Im Rahmen unserer Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten kommt es vor, dass diese an andere Stellen, Unternehmen, rechtlich selbstständige Organisationseinheiten oder Personen übermittelt beziehungsweise ihnen gegenüber offengelegt werden. Zu den Empfängern dieser Daten können z. B. mit IT-Aufgaben beauftragte Dienstleister gehören oder Anbieter von Diensten und Inhalten, die in eine Website eingebunden sind. In solchen Fällen beachten wir die gesetzlichen Vorgaben und schließen insbesondere entsprechende Verträge bzw. Vereinbarungen, die dem Schutz Ihrer Daten dienen, mit den Empfängern Ihrer Daten ab.

## Internationale Datentransfers {#m24}

Datenverarbeitung in Drittländern: Sofern wir Daten in einem Drittland (d. h., außerhalb der Europäischen Union (EU), des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR)) verarbeiten oder die Verarbeitung im Rahmen der Inanspruchnahme von Diensten Dritter oder der Offenlegung bzw. Übermittlung von Daten an andere Personen, Stellen oder Unternehmen stattfindet, erfolgt dies nur im Einklang mit den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Sofern das Datenschutzniveau in dem Drittland mittels eines Angemessenheitsbeschlusses anerkannt wurde (Art. 45 DSGVO), dient dieser als Grundlage des Datentransfers. Im Übrigen erfolgen Datentransfers nur dann, wenn das Datenschutzniveau anderweitig gesichert ist, insbesondere durch Standardvertragsklauseln (Art. 46 Abs. 2 lit. c) DSGVO), ausdrückliche Einwilligung oder im Fall vertraglicher oder gesetzlich erforderlicher Übermittlung (Art. 49 Abs. 1 DSGVO). Im Übrigen teilen wir Ihnen die Grundlagen der Drittlandübermittlung bei den einzelnen Anbietern aus dem Drittland mit, wobei die Angemessenheitsbeschlüsse als Grundlagen vorrangig gelten. Informationen zu Drittlandtransfers und vorliegenden Angemessenheitsbeschlüssen können dem Informationsangebot der EU-Kommission entnommen werden: [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection\_en?prefLang=de.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de) Im Rahmen des sogenannten „Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) hat die EU-Kommission das Datenschutzniveau ebenfalls für bestimmte Unternehmen aus den USA im Rahmen der Angemessenheitsbeschlusses vom 10.07.2023 als sicher anerkannt. Die Liste der zertifizierten Unternehmen als auch weitere Informationen zu dem DPF können Sie der Website des Handelsministeriums der USA unter [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/) (in Englisch) entnehmen. Wir informieren Sie im Rahmen der Datenschutzhinweise, welche von uns eingesetzten Diensteanbieter unter dem Data Privacy Framework zertifiziert sind.

## Allgemeine Informationen zur Datenspeicherung und Löschung {#m12}

Wir löschen personenbezogene Daten, die wir verarbeiten, gemäß den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen, sobald die zugrundeliegenden Einwilligungen widerrufen werden oder keine weiteren rechtlichen Grundlagen für die Verarbeitung bestehen. Dies betrifft Fälle, in denen der ursprüngliche Verarbeitungszweck entfällt oder die Daten nicht mehr benötigt werden. Ausnahmen von dieser Regelung bestehen, wenn gesetzliche Pflichten oder besondere Interessen eine längere Aufbewahrung oder Archivierung der Daten erfordern.

Insbesondere müssen Daten, die aus handels- oder steuerrechtlichen Gründen aufbewahrt werden müssen oder deren Speicherung notwendig ist zur Rechtsverfolgung oder zum Schutz der Rechte anderer natürlicher oder juristischer Personen, entsprechend archiviert werden.

Unsere Datenschutzhinweise enthalten zusätzliche Informationen zur Aufbewahrung und Löschung von Daten, die speziell für bestimmte Verarbeitungsprozesse gelten.

Bei mehreren Angaben zur Aufbewahrungsdauer oder Löschungsfristen eines Datums, ist stets die längste Frist maßgeblich.

Beginnt eine Frist nicht ausdrücklich zu einem bestimmten Datum und beträgt sie mindestens ein Jahr, so startet sie automatisch am Ende des Kalenderjahres, in dem das fristauslösende Ereignis eingetreten ist. Im Fall laufender Vertragsverhältnisse, in deren Rahmen Daten gespeichert werden, ist das fristauslösende Ereignis der Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Kündigung oder sonstige Beendigung des Rechtsverhältnisses.

Daten, die nicht mehr für den ursprünglich vorgesehenen Zweck, sondern aufgrund gesetzlicher Vorgaben oder anderer Gründe aufbewahrt werden, verarbeiten wir ausschließlich zu den Gründen, die ihre Aufbewahrung rechtfertigen.

## Einsatz von Cookies {#m134}

Unter dem Begriff „Cookies" werden Funktionen, die Informationen auf Endgeräten der Nutzer speichern und aus ihnen auslesen, verstanden. Cookies können ferner in Bezug auf unterschiedliche Anliegen Einsatz finden, etwa zu Zwecken der Funktionsfähigkeit, der Sicherheit und des Komforts von Onlineangeboten sowie der Erstellung von Analysen der Besucherströme. Wir verwenden Cookies gemäß den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. Dazu holen wir, wenn erforderlich, vorab die Zustimmung der Nutzer ein. Ist eine Zustimmung nicht notwendig, setzen wir auf unsere berechtigten Interessen. Dies gilt, wenn das Speichern und Auslesen von Informationen unerlässlich ist, um ausdrücklich angeforderte Inhalte und Funktionen bereitstellen zu können. Dazu zählen etwa die Speicherung von Einstellungen sowie die Sicherstellung der Funktionalität und Sicherheit unseres Onlineangebots. Die Einwilligung kann jederzeit widerrufen werden. Wir informieren klar über deren Umfang und welche Cookies genutzt werden.

**Hinweise zu datenschutzrechtlichen Rechtsgrundlagen:** Ob wir personenbezogene Daten mithilfe von Cookies verarbeiten, hängt von einer Einwilligung ab. Liegt eine Einwilligung vor, dient sie als Rechtsgrundlage. Ohne Einwilligung stützen wir uns auf unsere berechtigten Interessen, die vorstehend in diesem Abschnitt und im Kontext der jeweiligen Dienste und Verfahren erläutert sind.

**Speicherdauer:** Im Hinblick auf die Speicherdauer werden die folgenden Arten von Cookies unterschieden:

*   **Temporäre Cookies (auch: Session- oder Sitzungscookies):** Temporäre Cookies werden spätestens gelöscht, nachdem ein Nutzer ein Onlineangebot verlassen und sein Endgerät (z. B. Browser oder mobile Applikation) geschlossen hat.
*   **Permanente Cookies:** Permanente Cookies bleiben auch nach dem Schließen des Endgeräts gespeichert. So können beispielsweise der Log-in-Status gespeichert und bevorzugte Inhalte direkt angezeigt werden, wenn der Nutzer eine Website erneut besucht. Ebenso können die mithilfe von Cookies erhobenen Nutzerdaten zur Reichweitenmessung Verwendung finden. Sofern wir Nutzern keine expliziten Angaben zur Art und Speicherdauer von Cookies mitteilen (z. B. im Rahmen der Einholung der Einwilligung), sollten sie davon ausgehen, dass diese permanent sind und die Speicherdauer bis zu zwei Jahre betragen kann.

**Allgemeine Hinweise zum Widerruf und Widerspruch (Opt-out):** Nutzer können die von ihnen abgegebenen Einwilligungen jederzeit widerrufen und zudem einen Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorgaben, auch mittels der Privatsphäre-Einstellungen ihres Browsers, erklären.

*   **Verarbeitete Datenarten:** Meta-, Kommunikations- und Verfahrensdaten (z. B. IP-Adressen, Zeitangaben, Identifikationsnummern, beteiligte Personen).
*   **Betroffene Personen:** Nutzer (z. B. Webseitenbesucher, Nutzer von Onlinediensten).
*   **Rechtsgrundlagen:** Berechtigte Interessen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO). Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).

*   **Verarbeitung von Cookie-Daten auf Grundlage einer Einwilligung:** Wir setzen eine Einwilligungs-Management-Lösung ein, bei der die Einwilligung der Nutzer zur Verwendung von Cookies oder zu den im Rahmen der Einwilligungs-Management-Lösung genannten Verfahren und Anbietern eingeholt wird. Dieses Verfahren dient der Einholung, Protokollierung, Verwaltung und dem Widerruf von Einwilligungen, insbesondere bezogen auf den Einsatz von Cookies und vergleichbaren Technologien, die zur Speicherung, zum Auslesen und zur Verarbeitung von Informationen auf den Endgeräten der Nutzer eingesetzt werden. Im Rahmen dieses Verfahrens werden die Einwilligungen der Nutzer für die Nutzung von Cookies und die damit verbundenen Verarbeitungen von Informationen, einschließlich der im Einwilligungs-Management-Verfahren genannten spezifischen Verarbeitungen und Anbieter, eingeholt. Die Nutzer haben zudem die Möglichkeit, ihre Einwilligungen zu verwalten und zu widerrufen. Die Einwilligungserklärungen werden gespeichert, um eine erneute Abfrage zu vermeiden und den Nachweis der Einwilligung gemäß der gesetzlichen Anforderungen führen zu können. Die Speicherung erfolgt serverseitig und/oder in einem Cookie (sogenanntes Opt-In-Cookie) oder mittels vergleichbarer Technologien, um die Einwilligung einem spezifischen Nutzer oder dessen Gerät zuordnen zu können. Sofern keine spezifischen Angaben zu den Anbietern von Einwilligungs-Management-Diensten vorliegen, gelten folgende allgemeine Hinweise: Die Dauer der Speicherung der Einwilligung beträgt bis zu zwei Jahre. Dabei wird ein pseudonymer Nutzer-Identifikator erstellt, der zusammen mit dem Zeitpunkt der Einwilligung, den Angaben zum Umfang der Einwilligung (z. B. betreffende Kategorien von Cookies und/oder Diensteanbieter) sowie Informationen über den Browser, das System und das verwendete Endgerät gespeichert wird; **Rechtsgrundlagen:** Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).

## Präsenzen in sozialen Netzwerken (Social Media) {#m136}

Wir unterhalten Onlinepräsenzen innerhalb sozialer Netzwerke und verarbeiten in diesem Rahmen Nutzerdaten, um mit den dort aktiven Nutzern zu kommunizieren oder Informationen über uns anzubieten.

Wir weisen darauf hin, dass dabei Nutzerdaten außerhalb des Raumes der Europäischen Union verarbeitet werden können. Hierdurch können sich für die Nutzer Risiken ergeben, weil so zum Beispiel die Durchsetzung der Nutzerrechte erschwert werden könnte.

Ferner werden die Daten der Nutzer innerhalb sozialer Netzwerke im Regelfall für Marktforschungs- und Werbezwecke verarbeitet. So können beispielsweise anhand des Nutzungsverhaltens und sich daraus ergebender Interessen der Nutzer Nutzungsprofile erstellt werden. Letztere finden möglicherweise wiederum Verwendung, um etwa Werbeanzeigen innerhalb und außerhalb der Netzwerke zu schalten, die mutmaßlich den Interessen der Nutzer entsprechen. Daher werden im Regelfall Cookies auf den Rechnern der Nutzer gespeichert, in denen das Nutzungsverhalten und die Interessen der Nutzer gespeichert werden. Zudem können in den Nutzungsprofilen auch Daten unabhängig der von den Nutzern verwendeten Geräten gespeichert werden (insbesondere, wenn sie Mitglieder der jeweiligen Plattformen und dort eingeloggt sind).

Für eine detaillierte Darstellung der jeweiligen Verarbeitungsformen und der Widerspruchsmöglichkeiten (Opt-out) verweisen wir auf die Datenschutzerklärungen und Angaben der Betreiber der jeweiligen Netzwerke.

Auch im Fall von Auskunftsanfragen und der Geltendmachung von Betroffenenrechten weisen wir darauf hin, dass diese am effektivsten bei den Anbietern geltend gemacht werden können. Nur Letztere haben jeweils Zugriff auf die Nutzerdaten und können direkt entsprechende Maßnahmen ergreifen und Auskünfte geben. Sollten Sie dennoch Hilfe benötigen, dann können Sie sich an uns wenden.

*   **Verarbeitete Datenarten:** Kontaktdaten (z. B. Post- und E-Mail-Adressen oder Telefonnummern); Inhaltsdaten (z. B. textliche oder bildliche Nachrichten und Beiträge sowie die sie betreffenden Informationen, wie z. B. Angaben zur Autorenschaft oder Zeitpunkt der Erstellung). Nutzungsdaten (z. B.

## Plug-ins und eingebettete Funktionen sowie Inhalte {#m328}

Wir binden Funktions- und Inhaltselemente in unser Onlineangebot ein, die von den Servern ihrer jeweiligen Anbieter (nachfolgend als „Drittanbieter" bezeichnet) bezogen werden. Dabei kann es sich zum Beispiel um Grafiken, Videos oder Stadtpläne handeln (nachfolgend einheitlich als „Inhalte" bezeichnet).

Die Einbindung setzt immer voraus, dass die Drittanbieter dieser Inhalte die IP-Adresse der Nutzer verarbeiten, da sie ohne IP-Adresse die Inhalte nicht an deren Browser senden könnten. Die IP-Adresse ist damit für die Darstellung dieser Inhalte oder Funktionen erforderlich. Wir bemühen uns, nur solche Inhalte zu verwenden, deren jeweilige Anbieter die IP-Adresse lediglich zur Auslieferung der Inhalte anzuwenden. Drittanbieter können ferner sogenannte Pixel-Tags (unsichtbare Grafiken, auch als „Web Beacons" bezeichnet) für statistische oder Marketingzwecke einsetzen. Durch die „Pixel-Tags" können Informationen, wie etwa der Besucherverkehr auf den Seiten dieser Website, ausgewertet werden. Die pseudonymen Informationen können darüber hinaus in Cookies auf dem Gerät der Nutzer gespeichert werden und unter anderem technische Auskünfte zum Browser und zum Betriebssystem, zu verweisenden Websites, zur Besuchszeit sowie weitere Angaben zur Nutzung unseres Onlineangebots enthalten, aber auch mit solchen Informationen aus anderen Quellen verbunden werden.

**Hinweise zu Rechtsgrundlagen:** Sofern wir die Nutzer um ihre Einwilligung in den Einsatz der Drittanbieter bitten, stellt die Rechtsgrundlage der Datenverarbeitung die Erlaubnis dar. Ansonsten werden die Nutzerdaten auf Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen (d. h. Interesse an effizienten, wirtschaftlichen und empfängerfreundlichen Leistungen) verarbeitet. In diesem Zusammenhang möchten wir Sie auch auf die Informationen zur Verwendung von Cookies in dieser Datenschutzerklärung hinweisen.

*   **Einbindung von Drittsoftware, Skripten oder Frameworks (z. B. jQuery):** Wir binden in unser Onlineangebot Software ein, die wir von Servern anderer Anbieter abrufen (z. B. Funktions-Bibliotheken, die wir zwecks Darstellung oder Nutzerfreundlichkeit unseres Onlineangebotes verwenden). Hierbei erheben die jeweiligen Anbieter die IP-Adresse der Nutzer und können diese zu Zwecken der Übermittlung der Software an den Browser der Nutzer sowie zu Zwecken der Sicherheit, als auch zur Auswertung und Optimierung ihres Angebotes verarbeiten. - Wir binden in unser Onlineangebot Software ein, die wir von Servern anderer Anbieter abrufen (z. B.

*   **Google Fonts (Bezug vom Google Server):** Bezug von Schriften (und Symbolen) zum Zwecke einer technisch sicheren, wartungsfreien und effizienten Nutzung von Schriften und Symbolen im Hinblick auf Aktualität und Ladezeiten, deren einheitliche Darstellung und Berücksichtigung möglicher lizenzrechtlicher Beschränkungen. Dem Anbieter der Schriftarten wird die IP-Adresse des Nutzers mitgeteilt, damit die Schriftarten im Browser des Nutzers zur Verfügung gestellt werden können. Darüber hinaus werden technische Daten (Spracheinstellungen, Bildschirmauflösung, Betriebssystem, verwendete Hardware) übermittelt, die für die Bereitstellung der Schriften in Abhängigkeit von den verwendeten Geräten und der technischen Umgebung notwendig sind. Diese Daten können auf einem Server des Anbieters der Schriftarten in den USA verarbeitet werden - Beim Besuch unseres Onlineangebotes senden die Browser der Nutzer ihre Browser HTTP-Anfragen an die Google Fonts Web API (d. h. eine Softwareschnittstelle für den Abruf der Schriftarten). Die Google Fonts Web API stellt den Nutzern die Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) von Google Fonts und danach die in der CCS angegebenen Schriftarten zur Verfügung. Zu diesen HTTP-Anfragen gehören (1) die vom jeweiligen Nutzer für den Zugriff auf das Internet verwendete IP-Adresse, (2) die angeforderte URL auf dem Google-Server und (3) die HTTP-Header, einschließlich des User-Agents, der die Browser- und Betriebssystemversionen der Websitebesucher beschreibt, sowie die Verweis-URL (d. h. die Webseite, auf der die Google-Schriftart angezeigt werden soll). IP-Adressen werden weder auf Google-Servern protokolliert noch gespeichert und sie werden nicht analysiert. Die Google Fonts Web API protokolliert Details der HTTP-Anfragen (angeforderte URL, User-Agent und Verweis-URL). Der Zugriff auf diese Daten ist eingeschränkt und streng kontrolliert. Die angeforderte URL identifiziert die Schriftfamilien, für die der Nutzer Schriftarten laden möchte. Diese Daten werden protokolliert, damit Google bestimmen kann, wie oft eine bestimmte Schriftfamilie angefordert wird. Bei der Google Fonts Web API muss der User-Agent die Schriftart anpassen, die für den jeweiligen Browsertyp generiert wird. Der User-Agent wird in erster Linie zum Debugging protokolliert und verwendet, um aggregierte Nutzungsstatistiken zu generieren, mit denen die Beliebtheit von Schriftfamilien gemessen wird. Diese zusammengefassten Nutzungsstatistiken werden auf der Seite „Analysen" von Google Fonts veröffentlicht. Schließlich wird die Verweis-URL protokolliert, sodass die Daten für die Wartung der Produktion verwendet und ein aggregierter Bericht zu den Top-Integrationen basierend auf der Anzahl der Schriftartenanfragen generiert werden kann. Google verwendet laut eigener Auskunft keine der von Google Fonts erfassten Informationen, um Profile von Endnutzern zu erstellen oder zielgerichtete Anzeigen zu schalten; **Dienstanbieter:** Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland; **Rechtsgrundlagen:** Berechtigte Interessen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO); **Website:** [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/); **Datenschutzerklärung:** [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy); **Grundlage Drittlandtransfers:** Data Privacy Framework (DPF). **Weitere Informationen:** [https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=de](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=de).

In diesem Abschnitt erhalten Sie eine Übersicht über die in dieser Datenschutzerklärung verwendeten Begrifflichkeiten. Soweit die Begrifflichkeiten gesetzlich definiert sind, gelten deren gesetzliche Definitionen. Die nachfolgenden Erläuterungen sollen dagegen vor allem dem Verständnis dienen.

*   **Bestandsdaten:** Bestandsdaten umfassen wesentliche Informationen, die für die Identifikation und Verwaltung von Vertragspartnern, Benutzerkonten, Profilen und ähnlichen Zuordnungen notwendig sind. Diese Daten können u.a. persönliche und demografische Angaben wie Namen, Kontaktinformationen (Adressen, Telefonnummern, E-Mail-Adressen), Geburtsdaten und spezifische Identifikatoren (Benutzer-IDs) beinhalten. Bestandsdaten bilden die Grundlage für jegliche formelle Interaktion zwischen Personen und Diensten, Einrichtungen oder Systemen, indem sie eine eindeutige Zuordnung und Kommunikation ermöglichen.
*   **Inhaltsdaten:** Inhaltsdaten umfassen Informationen, die im Zuge der Erstellung, Bearbeitung und Veröffentlichung von Inhalten aller Art generiert werden. Diese Kategorie von Daten kann Texte, Bilder, Videos, Audiodateien und andere multimediale Inhalte einschließen, die auf verschiedenen Plattformen und Medien veröffentlicht werden. Inhaltsdaten sind nicht nur auf den eigentlichen Inhalt beschränkt, sondern beinhalten auch Metadaten, die Informationen über den Inhalt selbst liefern, wie Tags, Beschreibungen, Autoreninformationen und Veröffentlichungsdaten
*   **Kontaktdaten:** Kontaktdaten sind essentielle Informationen, die die Kommunikation mit Personen oder Organisationen ermöglichen. Sie umfassen u.a. Telefonnummern, postalische Adressen und E-Mail-Adressen, sowie Kommunikationsmittel wie soziale Medien-Handles und Instant-Messaging-Identifikatoren.
*   **Meta-, Kommunikations- und Verfahrensdaten:** Meta-, Kommunikations- und Verfahrensdaten sind Kategorien, die Informationen über die Art und Weise enthalten, wie Daten verarbeitet, übermittelt und verwaltet werden. Meta-Daten, auch bekannt als Daten über Daten, umfassen Informationen, die den Kontext, die Herkunft und die Struktur anderer Daten beschreiben. Sie können Angaben zur Dateigröße, dem Erstellungsdatum, dem Autor eines Dokuments und den Änderungshistorien beinhalten. Kommunikationsdaten erfassen den Austausch von Informationen zwischen Nutzern über verschiedene Kanäle, wie E-Mail-Verkehr, Anrufprotokolle, Nachrichten in sozialen Netzwerken und Chat-Verläufe, inklusive der beteiligten Personen, Zeitstempel und Übertragungswege. Verfahrensdaten beschreiben die Prozesse und Abläufe innerhalb von Systemen oder Organisationen, einschließlich Workflow-Dokumentationen, Protokolle von Transaktionen und Aktivitäten, sowie Audit-Logs, die zur Nachverfolgung und Überprüfung von Vorgängen verwendet werden.
*   **Nutzungsdaten:** Nutzungsdaten beziehen sich auf Informationen, die erfassen, wie Nutzer mit digitalen Produkten, Dienstleistungen oder Plattformen interagieren. Diese Daten umfassen eine breite Palette von Informationen, die aufzeigen, wie Nutzer Anwendungen nutzen, welche Funktionen sie bevorzugen, wie lange sie auf bestimmten Seiten verweilen und über welche Pfade sie durch eine Anwendung navigieren. Nutzungsdaten können auch die Häufigkeit der Nutzung, Zeitstempel von Aktivitäten, IP-Adressen, Geräteinformationen und Standortdaten einschließen. Sie sind besonders wertvoll für die Analyse des Nutzerverhaltens, die Optimierung von Benutzererfahrungen, das Personalisieren von Inhalten und das Verbessern von Produkten oder Dienstleistungen. Darüber hinaus spielen Nutzungsdaten eine entscheidende Rolle beim Erkennen von Trends, Vorlieben und möglichen Problembereichen innerhalb digitaler Angebote
*   **Personenbezogene Daten:** "Personenbezogene Daten" sind alle Informationen, die sich auf eine identifizierte oder identifizierbare natürliche Person (im Folgenden "betroffene Person") beziehen; als identifizierbar wird eine natürliche Person angesehen, die direkt oder indirekt, insbesondere mittels Zuordnung zu einer Kennung wie einem Namen, zu einer Kennnummer, zu Standortdaten, zu einer Online-Kennung (z. B. Cookie) oder zu einem oder mehreren besonderen Merkmalen identifiziert werden kann, die Ausdruck der physischen, physiologischen, genetischen, psychischen, wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen oder sozialen Identität dieser natürlichen Person sind.
*   **Profile mit nutzerbezogenen Informationen:** Die Verarbeitung von "Profilen mit nutzerbezogenen Informationen", bzw. kurz "Profilen" umfasst jede Art der automatisierten Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die darin besteht, dass diese personenbezogenen Daten verwendet werden, um bestimmte persönliche Aspekte, die sich auf eine natürliche Person beziehen (je nach Art der Profilbildung können dazu unterschiedliche Informationen betreffend die Demographie, Verhalten und Interessen, wie z. B. die Interaktion mit Webseiten und deren Inhalten, etc.) zu analysieren, zu bewerten oder, um sie vorherzusagen (z. B. die Interessen an bestimmten Inhalten oder Produkten, das Klickverhalten auf einer Webseite oder den Aufenthaltsort). Zu Zwecken des Profilings werden häufig Cookies und Web-Beacons eingesetzt.
*   **Protokolldaten:** Protokolldaten sind Informationen über Ereignisse oder Aktivitäten, die in einem System oder Netzwerk protokolliert wurden. Diese Daten enthalten typischerweise Informationen wie Zeitstempel, IP-Adressen, Benutzeraktionen, Fehlermeldungen und andere Details über die Nutzung oder den Betrieb eines Systems. Protokolldaten werden oft zur Analyse von Systemproblemen, zur Sicherheitsüberwachung oder zur Erstellung von Leistungsberichten verwendet.
*   **Verantwortlicher:** Als "Verantwortlicher" wird die natürliche oder juristische Person, Behörde, Einrichtung oder andere Stelle, die allein oder gemeinsam mit anderen über die Zwecke und Mittel der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten entscheidet, bezeichnet.
*   **Verarbeitung:** "Verarbeitung" ist jeder mit oder ohne Hilfe automatisierter Verfahren ausgeführte Vorgang oder jede solche Vorgangsreihe im Zusammenhang mit personenbezogenen Daten. Der Begriff reicht weit und umfasst praktisch jeden Umgang mit Daten, sei es das Erheben, das Auswerten, das Speichern, das Übermitteln oder das Löschen.

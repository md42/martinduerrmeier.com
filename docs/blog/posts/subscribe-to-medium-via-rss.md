# How to follow a medium publication via RSS

I enjoy using a feed reader to follow creators whose work interests me. Some of them are on Mediumâ€” for instance, Nick Tune, who writes excellent content on architecture modernisation.

TIL you can follow[^1] a publication via
```
medium.com/feed/[publication-name]
```

Nicks publication is under [medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog)

so I can follow it via
```
medium.com/feed/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog
```

# Systems Thinking - an Introduction

What is Systems Thinking and why is it also important for Software Development? Let's look at the water cycle. Remember the last time you saw a flood?  
<!-- more -->Why is there suddenly so much water that can take away cars, homes, even lives? Often it cannot be tracked back to a single event. It is the **interaction of elements**.  

- Rivers get less space to transport water way  
- a City is full of concrete that does not absorb water
- the Sun heats up concrete
- Concrete releases heat into the air
- Hot air rises and is condensing, leading to more moisture in the Air
- Once it starts raining the water cannot be absorbed nor transported away fast enough leading to flooding  

This is a **nonlinear system**. Systems Thinking is nonlinear.

## What is a linear System?

A server costs you say 10 EUR / day. If you add another, that's 20 EUR / day. There is a **disconnection between the elements**.

## Is Software Development linear or nonlinear?

Let's learn Python, it has 35 keywords. Once you know each keyword you know Python right? Wrong.  

You can however learn Python with a linear approach.  

1. Learn the def keyword  
2. Learn the built-In function print  
3. Write a hello world program  
4. Learn a new def keyword and start again

To further learn and better benefit from the language soon you need to structure the program you write.  

When building a web shop you don't want to write every functionality on your own.  

You use already developed parts and need to learn how to connect them.  
What are their **Relationships**?  
How do they interact?  
You create a new **Whole**.  
A mistake sneaks into the system. You start analyzing.  
There might be timing involved.  
You have assumptions.

You debug the program. You analyse the **elements** and their **Relationships**. You need to understand the **Whole**.

You apply Systems Thinking.  

Software Development is often a combination of linear and nonlinear thinking. A change in one part of the System can influence the whole System in unpredictable ways.

## Exercice for you

You plant 3 chili seeds.  
How many plants will you get?  
Is this a linear or a nonlinear system?

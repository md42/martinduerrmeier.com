# Systems Thinking - an Introduction

What is „Systems Thinking“ and, more importantly, why does it apply for Software Development? To understand this, let’s have a look at a water cycle. 
Remember the last time you saw a flood?  

<!-- more -->

Why is there suddenly so much water that is able to wash away cars, homes, even lives? 

Most of the times it cannot be linked to a single event. It’s a result of the **interaction of elements**.  

1. the available space for rivers to flow in is narrowing, so their ability to transport water is increasingly limited
2. cities are full of concrete, and concrete does not absorb water
3. sunshine heats up concrete
4. hot concrete releases heat back into the air, making it even warmer
5. Hot air rises and is condensing, leading to more moisture in the air
6. Once it starts raining the water cannot be absorbed nor transported away fast enough, ultimately leading to flooding  

This flow of events is called a **nonlinear system**. Systems Thinking is nonlinear.

## What is a linear System?

The cost for a rented server is e.g. 10 EUR a day. If you add another, that's 20 EUR a day. 

There is a **disconnection between the elements**.

## Is Software Development linear or nonlinear?

Imagine you want to lean the programming language Python, it consists of roughly 35 keywords. Once you know each keyword you know Python right? Wrong.  

You can however learn Python with a linear approach.  

1. Learn the def keyword  
2. Learn the built-In function print  
3. Write a hello world program  
4. Learn a new def keyword and start again

To further learn and improve being able to use the the language, you need to structure the program you write.  

When building a web shop you ideally don't want to write every functionality on your own.  

This is an explanatory and fictive way of what might happen:
 
- You reuse maybe already developed parts and need to learn how to connect them.
- What are their **Relationships**?  
- How do they interact between each other?  
- You create a new system as a **Whole**.  
- A mistake sneaks into the system. 
- You start analyzing.  
- There might be timing involved.  
- You take assumptions.
- You debug the program. 
-  You analyse the **elements** and their **Relationships**. 
- You need to understand your system as a **Whole**.

You apply Systems Thinking.  

Software Development is often a combination of linear and nonlinear thinking. A change in one part of the system can easily influence the overall system and its internal interactions in unpredictable ways.

## A thought experiment as an exercise

- You plant 3 chili seeds.  
- How many plants will you get?  
  
Is this a linear or a nonlinear system?

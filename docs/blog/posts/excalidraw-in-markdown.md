# embedd an excalidraw drawing in markdown

![Venn diagram with three circles: Innermost labeled "things I can influence," middle "things I can address," and outermost "outside my area of influence.](excalidraw-in-markdown/circles.excalidraw.png)

graphic inspired by circle of concern from Stephen Richards Covey

## how?

I'm using Visual Studio Code with [Excalidraw Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor). Name file e.g. circles.excalidraw.png draw with excalidraw directly in Visual Studio Code.

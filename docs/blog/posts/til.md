# Today I learned (TIL)

I'd like to improve my writing, that is why I created the blog. At the same time I was missing a mechanism to share small things i learned which are "not really worth a blog post".
The TIL category is for sharing those small things. For now I leave them in the blog with a tag [TIL](../tags/#tag:til).

So what did I learn today? **Instead of making a big concept**

- subdmain vs. url path
- in own git repo?
- can i have 2 "blogs" with mkdocs-material one for blogs and one for til
- til own RSS feed?
- ..

**I shall rather start**, because writing is the focus. Refactoring later once I have a better concept is ok.

Got the inspiration from [Simon Willison's TIL](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [Julia Evans TIL](https://jvns.ca/til/).
